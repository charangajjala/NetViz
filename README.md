# Dataset üóÉÔ∏è

The **UNSW-NB15** dataset is a comprehensive and modern computer network security dataset released in 2015 by the University of New South Wales. It contains realistic normal and abnormal network activities that are vital for research in network intrusion detection. The dataset is widely used for developing and testing machine learning models for cybersecurity applications.

## Key Features:

- **Total Records**: 2,540,044 instances.
- **Features**: 49 features, including 47 non-target features and 2 target features (label, attack_cat).
- **Attack Categories**: 10 different types of attacks including Normal, Generic, Exploits, Fuzzers, DoS, Reconnaissance, Backdoor, Shellcode, Worms, and Analysis.
- **Data Types**: The dataset includes basic, content, time, and general-purpose features derived from network flow records.

## Challenges:

- **Class Imbalance**: The dataset shows a significant imbalance, with 87% of instances belonging to the "Normal" category.
- **Class Overlap**: There is a considerable overlap between some attack classes, making accurate classification challenging.

## Access the Dataset

The dataset is publicly available for download from the official UNSW website. You can access it [here](https://research.unsw.edu.au/projects/unsw-nb15-dataset).

# üìä Results

## 1. **Class Imbalances**

- The **bar charts** highlight significant class imbalances in the UNSW-NB15 dataset, with the "Normal" attack class dominating at 87%.

### 2. **Heatmap Visualization**

- The **Mahalanobis Distance Heatmap** effectively showcases the distances between class centroids after applying different scaling techniques, helping to visualize class separations and overlaps.
- The heatmap revealed that **min-max scaling** improved separation between classes, reducing overlap, while **standard scaling** still exhibited some overlap.

## 3. **Feature Selection**

- The **Elastic Net Algorithm** identified 25 important features, significantly improving visualization clarity.

- **Random Forest** selected 35 features, though it included some less relevant ones, making Elastic Net the preferred method.

## 4. **Dimensionality Reduction**

- **PCA**: Visualized class overlaps in 2D and 3D, revealing significant overlaps in attack classes.

- **t-SNE**: Provided finer details, effectively showing the clustering of similar instances in the dataset.
  ![](Assets/2024-08-10-18-05-36.png)
- **LDA**: Revealed cluttered attack class distributions, confirming the presence of overlaps.

## 5. **Cluster Analysis**

- **K-means Intercluster Distance Map**: Demonstrated that certain attack classes (e.g., "Fuzzers") completely overlap with "Normal," indicating poor separation between classes.

## 6. **Visualization Dashboard**

- The dashboard integrates all visualizations, allowing for interactive exploration of class imbalances, overlaps, and feature importance.
- This comprehensive visual tool aids in understanding the dataset's challenges before model development.

# üöÄ Technical Details

## High-Level Architecture

![](Assets/2024-08-10-18-14-04.png)

## Methodology

The "NetViz" project follows a structured approach to visualize and analyze network intrusions using the UNSW-NB15 dataset. The methodology consists of several key steps:

### 1. **Data Acquisition and Cleaning**

- **Data Collection**: The UNSW-NB15 dataset was obtained and consolidated from multiple CSV files into a single dataset for analysis.
- **Data Cleaning**: Removed missing values and unnecessary columns, ensuring the dataset was clean and ready for processing.

### 2. **Data Preprocessing**

- **Label Encoding**: Nominal features were converted into numerical values using label encoding, except for the target column (`attack_cat`).
- **Feature Scaling**: Applied various scaling techniques, including min-max scaling, robust scaling, and standard scaling, to normalize the dataset. This step was critical for ensuring consistency across feature values.

### 3. **Feature Selection**

- **Elastic Net Algorithm**: Used to select the most important features by minimizing the impact of redundant and irrelevant features. This method helped to reduce complexity and improve visualization clarity.
- **Random Forest Algorithm**: Employed as an alternative feature selection method, but found to be less effective due to the inclusion of unnecessary features.

### 4. **Dimensionality Reduction**

- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Implemented to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and visualize the data in 2D and 3D. PCA helped in identifying significant overlaps among different attack classes.
- **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**: Applied to enhance the separation between different classes, particularly in 2D and 3D visualizations, though it revealed some cluttered distributions.
- **t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)**: Used for capturing finer details in the data, showing how similar instances cluster together.

### 5. **Heatmap Visualization**

- **Mahalanobis Distance Heatmap**: Created to visualize the distances between class centroids after applying different scaling techniques. This helped in identifying class separations and overlaps.

### 6. **Cluster Analysis**

- **K-means Clustering**: Performed to analyze the inter-cluster distances, revealing significant overlaps between certain attack classes, particularly between "Fuzzers" and "Normal."

### 7. **Dashboard Development**

- **Interactive Dashboard**: Developed using Plotly Dash to integrate all visualizations into a single interactive platform. The dashboard provides comprehensive insights into class imbalances, feature importance, and cluster distributions.

### 8. **Evaluation and Conclusion**

- **Analysis of Results**: The visualizations and analyses were evaluated to uncover critical issues such as class imbalances and overlaps, which are essential for improving network intrusion detection models.
- **Final Insights**: Conclusions were drawn based on the effectiveness of the visualizations and the identified challenges in the dataset.

This methodology ensures a thorough exploration of the dataset, providing valuable insights that contribute to the development of more robust network intrusion detection systems.
